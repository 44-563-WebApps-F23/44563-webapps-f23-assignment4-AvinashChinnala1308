            (SCENE.—The same. The door into the dining room is shut. It is
morning. MRS. STOCKMANN, with a sealed letter in her hand, comes in
from the dining room, goes to the door of the DOCTOR'S study, and peeps in.)
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
<h6 class="mrs-stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> Are you in, Thomas?
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="dr-stockmann">Dr. Stockmann</h6> <p class="direction">(from within his room)</p>. Yes, I have just come in. <p class="direction">(Comes
into the room.)</p> What is it?
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="mrs-stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> A letter from your brother.
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="dr-stockmann">Dr. Stockmann</h6> Aha, let us see! <p class="direction">(Opens the letter and reads:)</p> "I return
herewith the manuscript you sent me" <p class="direction">(reads on in a low murmur)</p> H'm!—
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="mrs-stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> What does he say?
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="dr-stockmann">Dr. Stockmann</h6> <p class="direction">(putting the papers in his pocket)</p>. Oh, he only writes
that he will come up here himself about midday.
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="mrs-stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> Well, try and remember to be at home this time.
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="dr-stockmann">Dr. Stockmann</h6> That will be all right; I have got through all my
morning visits.
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="mrs-stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> I am extremely curious to know how he takes it.
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="dr-stockmann">Dr. Stockmann</h6> You will see he won't like it's having been I, and not
he, that made the discovery.
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="mrs-stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> Aren't you a little nervous about that?
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="dr-stockmann">Dr. Stockmann</h6> Oh, he really will be pleased enough, you know. But, at
the same time, Peter is so confoundedly afraid of anyone's doing any
service to the town except himself.
</p>
<p class="speech">
<h6 class="mrs-stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann</h6> I will tell you what, Thomas—you should be good
natured, and share the credit of this with him. Couldn't you make out
that it was he who set you on the scent of this discovery?
